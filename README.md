# Random Password Generator
Random Password Generator is a simple Python program that generates strong passwords. It helps users create secure passwords that are difficult to guess or crack. The generated passwords can be used for various online accounts, such as email, social media, banking, and others, to protect personal information and data from unauthorized access.


## How it works
The password generation process is based on algorithms that consider various parameters such as length, complexity, and character types. The program provides the user with an option to customize the password generation process by specifying specific requirements, such as length and character types.

The program takes user input on the desired length of the password and prompts the user to choose the type of characters they want to include in the password. It then generates a random password that meets the specified criteria.
